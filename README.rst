L-Clip (LoRa Clip) 
==========================================
*Objective* - Development of small battery powered device for long-range, mesh-ish, communciation. The project has the following goals: 

 1. Utilization of HAM radio privlages for power (lets make HAM cool again!) 
 2. Cellphone will be used as terminal for device; therefore the device will need to communicate over BLE or Wi-Fi. 
 3. The device will implement the APRS protocol over LoRa and have the option to work as Digi-Repeater (if the cellphone has service), normal Repeater (if the cellphone is without server), and an APRS client. 
 4. The project should offer two physical implementaion, the first utilzing the HelTec-LoRa-32 board and the second using a custom board with an intergrated PA and improved RF paths. 

*Hardware* 

 * ESP32
 * 4MB Flash 
 * LoRa Semtech SX1278 Transciever 
 * Cellphone (Running Droid APRS or custom software)
